Your fingerprint is: {{ fingerprint }}

<br /><br />
<p>
This fingerprint is an easy to read version of your encryption keys. It's used to ensure that the keys are not tampered with at any time. It will be shown to users when they first install the desktop client. By requiring users to verify that the fingerprint they see matches the fingerprint shown here you can ensure that users have received the correct keys and no one outside of your organization can access your files.
