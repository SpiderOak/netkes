Your fingerprint is: {{ fingerprint }}

<br /><br />
<p>
This fingerprint is unique to your encryption keys. It will be shown to users when they first install the client. Have users verify that the fingerprint they see matches the fingerprint shown here. This will ensure that users have received the correct keys and no one outside of your organization can access your files.
